# CiscoRESTAPI
An application project for Cisco. Just a simple RESTful
API. I'm using Python because this is my first real API 
as well as my first "web server". Even though Python 
threads are only logical ones, I'll stick with a simpler 
language than something like Java or C while I figure 
out what I'm doing.
